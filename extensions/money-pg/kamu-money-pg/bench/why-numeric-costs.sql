-- WHY does `numeric` cost so much more than `kmoney` on YugabyteDB? NEVER a gate.
--
-- Run through kamu-money-pg/bench/run-bench-sql-yb.sh (`just bench-why-yb`).
--
-- Distinguish two explanations for numeric cost. `bytea` is variable-length like `numeric` and
-- opaque like `kmoney`, so the predictions differ:
--
--     varlena-vs-fixed  =>  bytea ~ numeric  >>  kmoney
--     numeric-specific  =>  bytea ~ kmoney   <<  numeric
--
-- The fixture establishes ordering and noise from each retained run. DocDB decimal translation
-- remains an inference; this file measures numeric-specific cost, not DocDB internals.
