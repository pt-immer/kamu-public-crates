-- What a pgrx call costs, and nothing else. NEVER a gate.
--
-- Driven by kamu-money-pg/bench/boundary/in-container.sh (`just bench-boundary`).
--
-- ============================================================================================
-- WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FIXTURE FROM sql-cost.sql
--
-- `sql-cost.sql` prices operations a schema actually performs, over a real table. This prices
-- the BOUNDARY: two functions with identical signatures, `bigint -> bigint`, each returning its
-- argument. One is five lines of C, one is a `#[pg_extern]`. Both pay fmgr dispatch; neither
-- does any work. The difference is pgrx's per-call wrapper and nothing else.
--
-- NO TABLE, ON PURPOSE, AND THIS IS THE POINT ON YUGABYTEDB. `generate_series` runs in the YSQL
-- backend, so DocDB is out of the path -- while the thread-local `YbCurrentMemoryContext` that
-- pgrx's wrapper touches on every call is exactly the same one. Over a real table YugabyteDB's
-- scan floor is ~378 ms against stock PostgreSQL's ~23 ms, and it is the floor's VARIANCE, not
-- its magnitude, that swamps a few nanoseconds: a large floor cancels on subtraction, an
-- unstable one does not. The distributed storage layer was never needed to measure the boundary.
--
-- THE SAMPLING IS sql-cost.sql's: a floor between every pair of operations, each operation
-- differenced against the mean of the floors either side of it, and the order rotated per pass.
-- Pairing and rotation keep drift from assigning a fixed bias to one operation.
--
-- SERIAL, ASSERTED. Wall time over N rows is time per row only if the rows went through one
-- process. The first attempt planned two workers and reported wall-clock-per-row as though it
-- were CPU-per-call.
