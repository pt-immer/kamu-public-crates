#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. `cargo pgrx test` manages its own PostgreSQL and cannot be aimed at
# YugabyteDB, so the 54 `#[pg_test]`s in kamu-money-pg/src/lib.rs -- which are this type's
# actual contract -- had never run there. Everything YugabyteDB was known to do came from one
# ~112-line script (yb/abi_battery.sql). This suite is that contract restated as SQL, so it
# runs against a single YB node, any node of a YB cluster, or the stock-PG15 reference,
# unchanged.
#
# WHY NOT THE `pg_regress` BINARY. It needs a --bindir and a schedule file, and the YugabyteDB
# image is not guaranteed to ship one. The shape is what matters, not the tool: sql/ +
# expected/, one output per case, an exact diff.
#
# THE SQL IS FED ON STDIN, never as a path. That is what lets one runner drive
# `docker exec -i <node> bin/ysqlsh ...` and a local `psql` with no transport code and without
# copying the suite into a container. The error-location prefix psql prints for a stdin script
# (`psql:<stdin>:12:`) is harness metadata and is normalized away below; the message text after
# it is kmoney's and is compared byte for byte.
#
# THE CLIENT MUST MERGE ITS OWN stderr INTO stdout, ON ITS OWN SIDE OF ANY TRANSPORT.
# This is a REQUIREMENT ON CALLERS, and it is not pedantry -- it was measured. `docker exec`
# carries stdout and stderr as two independently multiplexed streams, so a `2>&1` out here, on the
# host, cannot order them: expected-error output arrived one `\echo` section LATE, and only
# sometimes, which made 2 of 11 cases flaky rather than broken. Every caller therefore passes a
# client that redirects INSIDE the container (`bash -c 'exec ysqlsh "$@" 2>&1'`), so exactly one
# stream ever crosses the boundary. The `2>&1` below stays as a backstop for a local client.
#
# GOLDEN FILES ARE HAND-AUTHORED FROM THE LITERALS THE RUST TESTS ALREADY ASSERT, and there is
# deliberately NO REGENERATE MODE. A suite that can bless its own output certifies whatever it
# currently does -- the same reason yb/assert-battery.sh asserts values rather than shapes. To
# change a golden, change the assertion in lib.rs first, then copy the value across.

# TWO normalizations, and NOTHING else. Both remove something that describes the HARNESS rather
# than the type; every character of every refusal message is compared verbatim.
#
# 1. The error-location prefix -- `psql:<stdin>:12:` / `ysqlsh:/tmp/x.sql:12:`. Deleted rather than
#    replaced with a placeholder, because psql emits it INCONSISTENTLY: reading a script with `-f`
#    it prints `psql:<file>:<line>: ERROR: ...`, and reading the identical script on stdin it
#    prints a bare `ERROR: ...`. Measured on YugabyteDB 2025.2.5.1 -- the first run of this suite
#    failed 9 of 11 cases on exactly that, byte-identical message text underneath. Deleting it lets
#    one golden serve a stdin run here, an `-f` run in the PG15 reference, and anything later.
#
# 2. A trailing ` at character N`. Under VERBOSITY terse psql still appends the cursor POSITION for
#    errors that carry one -- and N is a byte offset into the statement text, so re-indenting a
#    query moves it. Pinning it would make these goldens depend on the whitespace of the .sql file
#    beside them, which is a property of nothing. The `#[pg_test(error = ...)]` attributes in
#    lib.rs do not carry it either, so keeping it would also make the port less faithful, not more.
