# Write the crafted BINARY COPY payloads 09-wire.sql feeds to `kmoney_recv`.
#
# Runs ON THE SERVER (the runner pipes it into `--server-exec`, e.g. `docker exec -i <node>
# bash`), because COPY ... FROM reads a path in the server's filesystem, not the client's.
#
# WHY A SHELL SCRIPT AND NOT SQL. `kmoney_recv` takes `internal`, which has no SQL literal, so
# the only in-database route to it is COPY (FORMAT BINARY) -- which needs a file whose bytes are
# deliberately wrong. SQL has no primitive that writes arbitrary bytes to a file. The Rust tests
# do it with std::fs from inside the backend; from out here it is printf.
#
# DEPENDENCIES: printf and chmod. Deliberately not python, xxd, dd or perl -- this has to run
# inside a stock YugabyteDB image and inside the stock-PG15 reference, and each extra tool is
# another thing that can be absent on one of them.
#
# THE LAYOUT, which every offset below depends on. A one-row one-field BINARY COPY file is:
#
#     11  signature   PGCOPY\n\377\r\n\0
#      4  flags       0
#      4  header ext  0
#      2  field count 1                     (int16, network order)
#      4  field len   18                    (int32, network order)
#     18  payload     16 LE units, 2 LE ISO 4217 numeric code
#      2  trailer     -1                    (int16 0xffff)
#     --
#     45  bytes
#
# so the payload occupies [25..43) and the trailer [43..45). Those are the same offsets the Rust
# tests use, and 09-wire.sql re-asserts the good payload against a live `kmoney_send` so this
# file cannot drift away from what the type actually writes.
