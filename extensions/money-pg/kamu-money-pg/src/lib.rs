//! `kmoney`: money as native PostgreSQL types, one per currency.
//!
//! Every ISO 4217 code gets its own fixed-width type -- `kmoney_usd`,
//! `kmoney_idr`, and the rest -- 16 bytes of canonical units with the currency
//! in the catalog rather than the value. Cross-currency arithmetic has no
//! operator to resolve and fails while the query is parsed. `kmoney_mixed`
//! remains the one deliberately currency-erased type (18 bytes, units plus the
//! ISO numeric code) for a column that must hold several currencies; it has no
//! arithmetic. `numeric(36,18)` is often smaller than either, but can round
//! excess precision before constraints inspect it.
//!
//! Text parsing, rendering, currency lookup, and arithmetic delegate to `kamu_money_core`.

// Match money-core's named restriction/nursery lints without enabling either
// unstable group wholesale. FFI casts are denied globally.
