# gathered from `yugabyted start` -- one node. Production YugabyteDB is several, and the things
# that only exist there are exactly the ones a money type cannot be wrong about: the .so has to be
# present on EVERY node at the same version, CREATE EXTENSION is DDL that must reach all of them,
# and a tablet split moves rows between nodes while `kmoney` values are sitting in columns.
#
# CONTAINER LIFETIME BELONGS TO THIS FILE, NOT TO WHOEVER REMEMBERS. The daemon here is shared
# across several organisations' runners, so: every container and the network carry this run's
# label, cleanup is scoped to that label and can therefore never touch another org's work, and the
# trap covers INT/TERM/HUP as well as EXIT because a kill during the readiness wait would
# otherwise orphan a three-node cluster.

# WHAT COUNTS AS RETRYABLE, in ONE place, for EVERY script that retries a transaction.
#
# It was two copies -- one in run-yb-concurrent.sh, one in run-yb-soak.sh -- and they had already
# drifted apart: the soak's list was missing `Restart`. A classifier that exists twice means the
# forgotten copy is the one deciding whether a real failure gets retried into silence, so it lives
# here, beside the cluster both scripts bring up.
#
# The same class had bitten once already inside run-yb-concurrent.sh, when its workers' list and
# its positive control's list disagreed about `deadlock`: the control watched a deliberately-forced
# write skew return `ERROR: deadlock detected ... kDeadlock [serializable]` -- exactly the error it
# existed to demand -- and reported that no retryable error had occurred.
#
# `deadlock` belongs here on YugabyteDB specifically: under SERIALIZABLE it takes read locks, so two
# transactions that read each other's rows before writing deadlock rather than raising a
# serialization failure. It is the same "abort and try again" contract under a different name, and
# YugabyteDB says so in the message itself.
#
# Matching on MESSAGE TEXT rather than SQLSTATE is a known weakness -- it is locale- and
# version-fragile, and a consuming service should classify on SQLSTATE instead. It is what a shell
# harness driving `ysqlsh` can see; the obligation is recorded rather than hidden.
