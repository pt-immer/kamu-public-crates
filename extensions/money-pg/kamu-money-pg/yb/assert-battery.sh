# Fail-closed oracle for the ABI battery (review F4, widened by review-3 N1/N2/N8).
#
# `yb-ab` diffs the YugabyteDB output against the stock-PG15 output. That proves the two engines
# produced the SAME bytes. It cannot prove they produced the RIGHT bytes, or that either one ran
# the experiment: two identical early failures, two empty files, or two matching truncated
# outputs all satisfy a diff. Worse, a kamu-money-pg SOURCE regression changes BOTH outputs
# identically, so the diff is structurally blind to it and this oracle is the only defence.
#
# An expected-error battery legitimately cannot use ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -- several probes exist to
# provoke errors whose TEXT is part of what must match. So the battery needs an EXTERNAL oracle
# instead. Equality only means something once both sides pass this.
#
# Usage: assert-battery.sh <output-file> <label> <client-exit-status>
#        assert-battery.sh --list          # print the assertion table (used by the selftest)
set -euo pipefail

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE ASSERTION TABLE.
#
# One list, consumed BOTH by the checker below and by assert-battery-selftest.sh through
# `--list`. That coupling is deliberate and is the fix for review-3 N1: the previous selftest
# hard-coded its own mutations, covered 6 of 10 assertions, and still printed "every assertion
# still bites". Driving the control from this table means an assertion added here is negatively
# controlled automatically, by construction rather than by remembering.
#
# Fields: MODE %%% PATTERN %%% EXPECTED %%% DESCRIPTION   (%%% cannot occur in SQL output)
#   F  fixed-string match (grep -F). Preferred: no escaping, no column-width fragility.
#   E  extended regex (grep -E). Only where a fixed substring would be ambiguous.
#   H  header -> value: the line matching PATTERN must be followed 2 lines later by EXPECTED
#      (psql renders `header`, `-----`, `value`). For one-column results whose value alone
#      ("t", "2") is far too generic to pin on its own.
#
# VALUES, not shapes. review-3 N2 demonstrated six realistic regressions passing the old oracle
# because it asserted `18 |` (a width) rather than the payload, and never asserted the arithmetic
# results at all.
