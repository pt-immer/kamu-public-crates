#
# WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY A FORK DID NOT MAKE IT REDUNDANT. The three adaptations are facts about
# YugabyteDB's headers, and a YugabyteDB release is free to change any of them. The compiler now
# catches the loudest case -- a fork's patch that no longer applies is a compile error, which the
# old textual shim could not promise -- but it cannot catch the quiet one: an adaptation that still
# compiles while no longer being the RIGHT adaptation. `index_build_range_scan` dropping back to 11
# parameters would compile with three arguments too many; the alias would still compile if YB
# restored a process-global `CurrentMemoryContext` beside the thread-local one, and would then
# shadow it. Money read through the wrong memory context is the failure at the end of that path.
#
# So the shape is asserted at build time, BEFORE the extension is compiled, and a mismatch fails
# the build naming the symbol that moved. That is the P1.1 conversion the readiness plan asks for:
# a production incident becomes a build failure.
#
# Two different questions -- "is the world still shaped the way we assumed?" and "did our change
# compile?" -- and only the compiler answers the second.

# real process-global with a thread-local one, which is the bug this whole shim exists to avoid.

This image's headers no longer match the ABI the pgrx fork's `yb-pg15` feature was derived and
validated against. Do NOT relax this probe to get a build through: an adaptation that no longer
matches the headers can still COMPILE, and then it is silently the wrong adaptation.

The procedure for adopting a new YugabyteDB version is in kamu-money-pg/yb/RUNBOOK.md.
