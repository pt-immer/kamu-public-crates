# `kmoney` on YugabyteDB — operator runbook

This runbook covers YugabyteDB image adoption, pgrx-fork updates, diagnosis,
deployment order, and rollback. Commands run from the repository root.

YugabyteDB can host pgrx extensions, but `kmoney` is not a vendor-supported
extension. The `yb-pg15` adaptations are maintained by this project. Managed
platforms that reject third-party native extensions must use the canonical-text
adapter described in [Fallback](#fallback-to-canonical-text).

## Standing support condition

The supported native combination is defined by four pins:

| Pin | Source of truth |
| --- | --- |
| YugabyteDB image | [`YB-PINNED.txt`](YB-PINNED.txt), tag plus registry digest |
| pgrx fork | lane-root `Cargo.toml` `[patch.crates-io]` |
| pgrx version | `kamu-money-pg/Cargo.toml` and Docker build arguments |
| Rust version | lane-root `rust-toolchain.toml` and `workspace.package.rust-version` |

The fork is
[`pt-immer/pgrx-yugabytedb`](https://github.com/pt-immer/pgrx-yugabytedb),
tagged `v0.19.2-yb.1` for the current pgrx 0.19.2 base. Its `yb-pg15` feature
adapts three YugabyteDB differences:

| YugabyteDB difference | Fork adaptation |
| --- | --- |
| YSQL memory context is thread-local | Alias to `YbCurrentMemoryContext` |
| `index_build_range_scan` has three additional parameters | Supply the YB arguments at generated call sites |
| `BackgroundWorker` has `bgw_oom_score_adj` | Initialize the additional field |

`probe-yb-abi.sh` checks those assumptions against the selected image's headers
before compilation. The Rust compiler then verifies that the fork still builds.

`yb-image.sh` resolves tags through the registry and fails closed:

- `YB_ALLOW_UNPINNED=1` permits evaluation of a tag absent from the pin file;
- `YB_ALLOW_DRIFT=1` permits evaluation when a recorded tag resolves to a new
  digest.

These variables are investigation overrides, not deployment settings. Neither
changes `YB-PINNED.txt`.

## Adopt a YugabyteDB image

Do not edit the pin first. The unrecorded or changed digest must fail before an
override proves the evaluation path is active.

```bash
NEW='yugabytedb/yugabyte:<new-tag>'
RESOLVER='extensions/money-pg/kamu-money-pg/yb/yb-image.sh'

# Expected to refuse. Record the immutable digest printed in the diagnostic.
YB_PULL=1 "$RESOLVER" "$NEW"

# For a new tag:
YB_ALLOW_UNPINNED=1 just pg yb-build "$NEW"
YB_ALLOW_UNPINNED=1 just pg gate-pg-release "$NEW"
YB_ALLOW_UNPINNED=1 just pg test-yb-deployment "$NEW"

# For a recorded tag whose digest moved, use YB_ALLOW_DRIFT=1 instead.
```

The release gate:

1. resolves one immutable base image;
2. disables the local `kamu-money-core` Cargo patch;
3. runs the offline and PostgreSQL 15–18 gates;
4. builds one node image and extracts the artifact from it;
5. compares YugabyteDB with stock PostgreSQL 15, byte for byte;
6. runs the portable cases against that node image;
7. refuses benchmark-only symbols in the shipped artifact.

It proves the extension is correct on YugabyteDB, and stops there. `just pg
test-yb-deployment` covers three-node behaviour, a read replica, concurrent
transfers and same-version dump/restore — those describe how a cluster carries
the extension, which is why adopting an image runs both.

If the gate passes:

1. replace or add the exact `tag<TAB>digest` row in `YB-PINNED.txt`;
2. rerun without an override:

   ```bash
   YB_PULL=1 just pg gate-pg-release "$NEW"
   YB_PULL=1 just pg test-yb-deployment "$NEW"
   ```

3. update this runbook only if the support condition or procedure changed;
4. commit the pin and any required code changes together.

If the build or gate fails, keep the old pin. Re-derive the fork adaptation or
use the text fallback. Do not weaken the header probe to make an unknown image
pass.

## Update pgrx or the fork

A fork change is released in the fork repository first:

```bash
git checkout -b yugabytedb-<version> v<version>
git cherry-pick <previous yb commit>
git tag -s v<version>-yb.1
git push origin yugabytedb-<version> v<version>-yb.1
```

Every line of the adaptation is a comment or inside `cfg(feature = "yb-pg15")`, so it
adds lines and modifies none. A cherry-pick that conflicts therefore means upstream
touched the same lines, which is the signal to re-derive rather than re-apply. Confirm
the arity assumption survived the bump before trusting a clean pick — the count of
inserted arguments in `pgrx-pg-sys/src/include.rs` is the number of generated call sites
times three.

Then update this repository:

1. change both `[patch.crates-io]` entries in
   `extensions/money-pg/Cargo.toml`;
2. change pgrx and pgrx-test requirements in
   `extensions/money-pg/kamu-money-pg/Cargo.toml`;
3. update every Docker `cargo-pgrx` pin, the `.config/dev-tools.json` entry, and the
   workflow's `cargo-pgrx@` pins and `~/.pgrx` cache keys;
4. review every remaining version-specific claim. The pins themselves are checked by
   `hygiene/tests/pgrx_pin.rs`, so this step is only for prose that names a version and
   for behaviour a new release may have changed:

   ```bash
   git grep -nE 'pgrx [0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' -- . ':!*.lock'
   ```

   A comment such as "pgrx has no safe mapping for `internal`" is a claim about the
   release it names. Re-read the new source before moving its number.

5. refresh the lane lockfile;
6. run:

   ```bash
   just pg setup
   just pg doctor
   just gate-all
   ```

`cargo-pgrx` must exactly match the pgrx dependency version.

For an unpushed fork revision, a local checkout may temporarily live at
`extensions/money-pg/vendor/pgrx-yugabytedb`; the lane excludes `vendor` from
workspace discovery. Never commit a path patch as the release configuration.

## Diagnose a failure

| Symptom | Meaning and action |
| --- | --- |
| `tag has moved off the validated digest` | Registry content changed. Follow image adoption with `YB_ALLOW_DRIFT=1`; do not change the pin before the gate passes. |
| `tag is not recorded in the pin file` | No supported digest exists. Follow image adoption with `YB_ALLOW_UNPINNED=1`. |
| `probe-yb-abi: FAILED` | A header assumption changed. Re-derive the relevant fork adaptation. |
| Compile error in `pgrx` or `pgrx-pg-sys` | The fork no longer applies to the chosen pgrx/YB combination. Update the fork; do not patch generated source in a container. |
| `INCOHERENT TRIPLET` or `MANIFEST MISMATCH` | Shared object, control file, and SQL came from different builds. Delete that run's private output and rebuild as one artifact. |
| `could not access file "$libdir/kmoney"` on one node | That node lacks the extension library. Roll the same image to every tserver, including read replicas. |
| Stock PG15 and YugabyteDB fail the same case | Extension or portable-case defect. Start with `just pg test-pg 15`. |
| Stock PG15 passes and YugabyteDB fails | YugabyteDB divergence. Use the named case and golden diff to isolate the contract. |

Useful diagnostics:

```bash
just pg yb-pin-check
just pg yb-image-selftest
just pg yb-native
just pg test-yb-regress
docker ps -a --filter 'label=kamu-money-pg.revision'
```

The final command is read-only. Cleanup scripts target only containers and
networks labeled by this lane.

## Fallback to canonical text

If native loading is unavailable, enable `kamu-money-core`'s `postgres` or
`sqlx` feature and store canonical strings such as `USD 10.50` in a PostgreSQL
`text` column.

The fallback retains:

- the same parser, renderer, domain, and currency register;
- exact scalar and array round trips;
- compatibility with PostgreSQL and YugabyteDB without a native extension.

It gives up:

- database arithmetic, division, allocation, and the per-currency `sum()`;
- per-currency column typing — `kmoney_usd` refusing a foreign currency at
  input and cross-currency expressions failing to parse;
- the fixed 16-byte pinned and 18-byte mixed native representations.

This is a mechanism migration, not a value-format migration. The native
input/output functions and portable adapters share the canonical codec.

One exposure the fallback shares with the native path: its rows store tagged
text (`USD 10.50`), so a register update that removed a currency would make
historical fallback rows of that currency unreadable too. The register's
append-only policy (`crates/money-core/VENDORED.md`, "Identity facts are
append-only") is what protects both representations.

## Deploy

This repository does not publish a production node image. A consuming platform
builds the node-image target from a signed source revision, pushes it to its own
registry, and deploys by registry digest.

The database order is mandatory:

1. Build and pass `just pg gate-pg-release` against the exact base digest.
2. Publish the consumer-owned node image and record its immutable digest.
3. Roll that image to every YSQL tserver and read replica.
4. Confirm every node is on the intended digest.
5. Run `CREATE EXTENSION kmoney` for first install, or
   `ALTER EXTENSION kmoney UPDATE` for an upgrade, once per cluster.
6. Recycle long-lived database connections so every backend loads the new
   library.

Binary first, catalog second. During a rolling image update, new binaries must
remain compatible with the current catalog until step 5 completes.

`CREATE EXTENSION kmoney` creates the full generated catalog — 178 per-currency
type families, several thousand objects — through yb-master in one statement.
Expect it to take longer than a typical extension install, run it in a quiet
window, and treat a partial failure (for example across a master leader change)
as undefined catalog state: `DROP EXTENSION kmoney` and re-run the statement
rather than reasoning about which objects survived. Its atomicity under a
mid-statement master failover is a property of the YugabyteDB version's DDL
handling, not of this extension, and has not been rehearsed here.

### What `gate-pg-release` compiles from

Step 1's artifact is compiled from an empty dependency cache, and that is a
property of the build rather than of anyone's memory. The YugabyteDB image
compiles its dependencies in a layer of their own, and `gate-pg-release` exports
a `KMONEY_CACHE_ID` derived per run from the shell's PID and `/dev/urandom`. The
Dockerfile expands that value inside the dependency compile, and BuildKit keys a
`RUN` on its expanded command, so no earlier layer can match and the graph is
rebuilt.

Ordinary builds leave `KMONEY_CACHE_ID` at `shared` and reuse that layer, which
is what CI restores. The base image, the toolchain and `cargo-pgrx` stay cached
either way: the claim is about the dependency graph the shipped library links,
not about `dnf`.

`hygiene/tests/packaging.rs` asserts the expansion rather than the declaration.
An `ARG` that is declared and never referenced scopes nothing and changes no
cache key, so the proof would go on claiming a from-scratch compile while
assembling one out of whatever the daemon happened to hold.

### Roll back

Before the catalog update, roll back by redeploying the previous image digest.

After `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE`, do not deploy the old binary unless an explicit
downgrade script and compatibility proof exist. The old library may not match
the new catalog. Treat the catalog update as the rollback cutoff.

Keep the previous image digest deployable until the new rollout, catalog update,
connection recycle, and smoke tests are complete.

### Restore

`just pg test-yb-restore` proves same-version dump/restore into a clean cluster.
The target must already run an image containing `kmoney`; PostgreSQL dumps
`CREATE EXTENSION`, not the extension's member objects or shared library.

This test does not define backup cadence, RPO, RTO, retention, or operator
authority. The consuming platform owns those controls.

### Extension version changes

`0.1.0 → 0.2.0` has no upgrade script, deliberately. The bump removes the
`kmoney` type and narrows the stored payload 18 → 16 bytes, and
`ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE` can carry neither: a type cannot be dropped from under
its columns, and a payload change is a storage migration, not a catalog edit.
The supported path is dump → transform → restore:

1. On `0.1.0`, dump. `pg_dump` emits every `kmoney` value through `kmoney_out`
   as tagged text — `USD 10.50`.
2. In the dumped schema, retype each column: `kmoney('USD')` becomes
   `kmoney_usd`; a column that genuinely holds several currencies becomes
   `kmoney_mixed`.
3. Restore into a cluster running `0.2.0`. Pinned input accepts the tagged form
   and refuses a tag that disagrees with the column's type, so a column mapped
   to the wrong currency aborts the restore at the first mismatched row instead
   of having its digits reinterpreted. The transform is checked by the wire,
   not by the operator's diligence.

Later bumps follow the original rule: a release that keeps every type and
stored payload adds the corresponding `kmoney--old--new.sql` script, because
PostgreSQL refuses `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE` without a valid upgrade path. A
release that changes a stored payload is a storage migration and repeats the
dump → transform → restore rehearsal, with explicit old/new decoding and
cross-version tests.

## Evidence limits

- One YugabyteDB digest is supported at a time.
- Same-version restart, node failure/rejoin, and dump/restore are tested.
- A two-version rolling YugabyteDB upgrade is not yet rehearsed.
- No `kmoney--old--new.sql` upgrade script has ever shipped, and no delta
  generator exists: the first register ADDITION will require a hand-authored
  script carrying that currency's full object family, plus a
  fresh-install-versus-upgrade equivalence test. Neither is rehearsed.
- `CREATE EXTENSION` atomicity under a mid-statement master failover is
  untested; the runbook's answer is drop-and-retry, not resumption.
- The node image produced here is a test fixture, not a published deliverable.
- Benchmarks compare mechanisms on one host; they are not portable thresholds.
- Native extension support does not cover managed services that prohibit custom
  shared libraries.
