//! The lane pins two toolchains, and each is ONE fact spelled in many places: pgrx across
//! manifests, Dockerfiles, the tool manifest and CI, and Rust across `rust-toolchain.toml`,
//! three container images, and the toolchain step of every CI job that enters the lane. That
//! last one is bound in `scripts/test_workflows.py` rather than here, because which jobs those
//! are is workflow policy; the version it compares against is read from the same
//! `rust-toolchain.toml` this file derives from.
//!
//! The lane's MSRV is a THIRD fact, spelled in `clippy.toml` and the lane manifest, and it is
//! not the pinned toolchain. An MSRV is the oldest compiler the lane supports; the channel is
//! the one it is built with. Deriving either from the other would re-declare a floor nobody
//! verified, and would leave `clippy::incompatible_msrv` comparing the compiler against itself,
//! unable to report anything. What ties them is an inequality, checked below.
//!
//! The two disagree differently, which is why both are here.
//!
//! `cargo-pgrx` refuses to build an extension whose `pgrx` dependency differs from the CLI's
//! own version, because the SQL it generates and the FFI shims it links are versioned
//! together. A site left on the old number is not a cosmetic lag: it is a build that fails,
//! wherever that site is read -- inside a container, on a CI runner, or on the machine of
//! whoever runs `just setup` next.
//!
//! Rust fails the other way, silently. `rust-toolchain.toml` wins over whatever a base image
//! ships, so the compiler is always the pinned one and the tests are always right. What a
//! mismatch costs is a second toolchain downloaded inside every container, on every run,
//! without ever producing a wrong answer to notice it by. It went unseen until a layer
//! measurement asked why the image had grown by 305 MB.
//!
//! Every expectation below is DERIVED from the pin it checks, so this file holds no version
//! number and cannot become the second list it exists to prevent. What it does hold is the
//! list of PLACES, each asserted through an anchor that must be present -- so a renamed
//! directive or a moved file fails loudly rather than passing because it matched nothing.
